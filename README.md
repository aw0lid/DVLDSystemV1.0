- **Error Handling & Validation** – Ensures reliability and user-friendly feedback.

## Future Enhancements
A more advanced version of the system will be released with **comprehensive improvements and expansions**, featuring a **higher-level ARC architecture** for better maintainability, stability, and professional-grade design.  
The upcoming version will include:
- System-wide enhancements for stability, performance, and scalability.
- Improved user experience and more efficient system management.
- Expanded functionalities to cover more aspects of license management and workflow automation.
- A fundamentally improved system architecture (ARC) for long-term maintainability and professional design.
